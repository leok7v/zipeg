<body>
<p>Many Thanks to all the people whose help made Zipeg possible.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>to my Teachers - who taught me the simplicity and elegance
of math and programming.
  </li>
  <li>to my Family - for puting up with me.</li>
  <li>to all beta users - for their patience, crash reporting, features suggestions, criticism
    and helping to improve the application.</li>
  <li>John Seryukov - for his support, ideas, discussions and
help with web hosting of Zipeg project.
  </li>
  <li>Alex Lelievre - for a lot of help with Mac OS X, tools,
frameworks and
initial implementation of file association handling code.
  </li>
  <li>Igor Pavlov - for his excellent p7zip
framework without which
handling of 7z, rar and most of other non-zip archive formats would
be much more difficult to implement. Also for a lot of patience helping
other people to read and understand his code.
  </li>
  <li>Shy Shalom, Kohei Taketa - for juniversalchardet.
  </li>
  <li>Mad Bwana - for ShinyBlack Classic icons.
