<body>
This package contains the "plug-in driver" interface which TrueZIP's file
API in the package {@link de.schlichtherle.io} uses to access supported
archive types, such as ZIP32 or TAR for example.
<p>
To implement support for a custom archive type, developers must implement
the interfaces in this package and either provide a custom implementation
of the {@link de.schlichtherle.io.ArchiveDetector} interface or register
with the {@link de.schlichtherle.io.DefaultArchiveDetector} class.
