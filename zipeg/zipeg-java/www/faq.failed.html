  <p>There are multiple reasons for possible problems with opening or extracting files from archives. Most common are:
   </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Archive was corrupted in transit. Try to download archive again.</li>
    <li>Archive is password protected and password you supplied is incorrect.</li>
    <li>The format of the archive is not supported by zipeg.</li>
    <li>If you believe that the issue is in Zipeg - please let me know I will try to investigate and fix it.</li>
  </ul>
  For password protected archives please contact the person who created the archive and request correct password. Passwords are case sensitive.
